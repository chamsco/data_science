# twitter_crypto_bot
This is a cryptocurrency trading bot that analyses Twitter sentiment about certain cryptos and will put Buy/Sell orders on a Crypto Trading App based on those tweets Sentiment.

The bot features several customisation options allowing you to target any relevant Hashtag or $ as well as a defined set of keywords to look out for.

In addition to the library requirements you will also need a Twitter Developper Account and a Kucoin Account (will implement a Binance version later-on)
